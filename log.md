Description: Managed to wrap my head around how the VGA output works... hence we have colors which will be used for each 2048 block.

Then moved on to adding a 4x4 game grid with coloring logic based on block value.

Block value is/will be represented by a number from 0-11, corresponding to the powers of 2 (2^11 = 2048).
