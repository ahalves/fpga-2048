The classic game of 2048, with VGA output from an FPGA.

## How To Run
Go to [VGA Playground](https://editor.bitstream.hackclub.com). Then, clone the repository by clicking on the "Clone" button of the "GitHub" button in the toolbar. You may need to add a GitHub access token before cloning. You can get the link for cloning the repo by clicking on the green "Code" button in GitHub. Once cloned in the VGA editor, it should start running immediately, unless there is an error with the code.
